    During times like these it's easy to feel powerless, but it's important to remember there are many ways to help. It starts by staying informed. Read the news and check out the websites on our <a href="Resources.html">resources</a> page. Being informed and credible is extremely powerful. Spread what you've learned to people around you as well. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Petitions are also great ways to take action! Petitions help legitimize a campaign as well as show decision-makers the level of support for an issue. Below is a list of petitions you can sign if you are passionate about keeping bodily autonomy in America.

    Another way to show officials you care is by calling. You can almost always find your representative's number online. If you don't know your representative you can go to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a> to find their profile and along with it- a number to call. By making your calls more personal and including how the issue you're arguing against has impacted you, your message is more likely to get passed along. However, using a script is also a great way to show you care.
