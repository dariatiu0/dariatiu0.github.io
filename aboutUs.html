     <h1> About Us</h1>
      <p> We are three teens who are passionate about bodily autonomy and advocacy. In light of the recent Supreme Court decision, we decided that enough was enough. It is time to fight for change, education, and basic rights. Women should be able to make decisions about their body. Medical care in all forms is necessary for the well being of anyone, and it starts with access. We chose to express our anger and fervor through a website. Coding has been a passion of ours for a long time and through Girls Who Code we gained knowledge of the skill. When tasked to create a website advocating for a cause we believe in, we chose bodily autonomy. We want to educate others on their rights over their body. Combining our passion with technology, we were able to create an educational website.
