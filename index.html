        <p>Having the freedom to make choices over your body empowers many, making people less susceptible to sexual

      <h2>Who has bodily autonomy?</h2>
      <p id="longpara">Long story short, everyone should have bodily autonomy. However, some people, such as men, have more bodily
        autonomy. In todays world, bodily autonomy is under attack for women, non-binary people, and trans people. Many
        minorities do not have access to sexual education and resources that allow them to choose what happens to their
        bodies. Right now, with the overturn of Roe V Wade, people may not have access to abortion clinics, birth
        control, and a multitude of other important resources. America's government is limiting the options that women
        and many other people have. This creates a lack of bodily autonomy. People are not allowed to govern their
        bodies. Governments are controlling this right. They wont stop with abortion and birth control access either.
        Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas implied that other established, fundamental rights would be reconsidered
        in the future - including a ban on same-sex marriage. By banning right to choose who you want to marry
        eliminates the right to choose. Aka the lack of bodily autonomy.

      <p>Bodily autonomy is under attack in America. Pregnant people, menstruating people, people who have sex, LGBTQ
        people, and people who just want to choose what happens to their body are being silenced and controlled. Visit
